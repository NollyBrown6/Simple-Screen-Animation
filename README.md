# Simple Screen Animation Project: website vs coding interface

## Introduction

![Screenshot displaying the project: a screen showcasing a website and a coding interface](/result/simple-screen-snimation_result.png)

This simple project focuses on HTML and CSS to display a small screen showcasing a website on one side and a coding interface on the other. I wanted to enhance the homepage of my portfolio by integrating a React component to make it look more dynamic. I drew inspiration from [Ricardo dos Santos' project in Code Pen](https://codepen.io/whhhhhhaaaaaaat) to create this component.

## Approach

Despite its apparent simplicity (as it solely utilizes basic HTML and CSS), the project is actually a series of `<div>` elements that structure the display of the various components featured on this small screen. This intricate layout led me to turn it into a separate project, which I will later integrate into my portfolio. This allowed me to focus on the finer details and the precision of organizing my code.

In terms of CSS, I had fun playing with the colour and size of the elements to make the interface dynamic and lively.
